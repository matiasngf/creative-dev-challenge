I'll use the things to evaluate to guide my documentation process.

[Tracks DOM elements and draws Three.js objects in their place using the correct scale and position (for images and models).](./track-dom-elements.md)
[Implement Lenis for smooth and accessible scrolling, so everyone can enjoy your website.]
[Add a custom shader to make hover image interaction more engaging and immersive.]
[Make sure the Awwwards model rotates during scroll movement, adding some excitement to your website.]
[Pin the Caps section in place and have the caps appear with opacity, scale, and rotation during scroll movement. Also, ensure that each cap remains floating, and create this animation using a GSAP Timeline.]
[Ensure your website is optimized for devices up to an iPad.]
